# AI Image Metadata Viewer (prompt-viewer)

A web application for parsing and displaying metadata (prompts, etc.) of images generated by AI.
It runs in your local environment, so images are never uploaded to an external server.

## Features

*   Easily check prompts and setting information of images generated by AI.
*   Upload images via drag-and-drop or file selection.
*   Buttons to individually copy the prompt, negative prompt, and other setting information.
*   Supports both Japanese and English display.

## Supported Formats

*   JPEG
*   PNG

It primarily supports images generated by tools like Stable Diffusion (AUTOMATIC1111 web UI) .

## Usage

1.  Open the web page.
2.  Drag and drop an image file onto the "Drag and drop JPEG/PNG images here" area, or select an image file by clicking the "Select File" button.
3.  The image's metadata will be automatically parsed and displayed on the screen.
4.  Click the copy button next to each field to copy its content to the clipboard.
